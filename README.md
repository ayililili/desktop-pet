# Desktop Pet

A simple desktop pet implemented in Python with `tkinter`. The pet walks around the screen and can be dragged with the mouse. It occasionally performs a short dash toward the cursor.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pillow

Install Pillow with:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will create a frameless window with an animated GIF of the pet.
